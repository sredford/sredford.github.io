<h1>AeroSHARK reduces emissions by 1.1%</h1>

  <h4>Adds uncertainty to passenger CO<sub>2</sub> calculations</h4>

<p>This summer Swiss are becoming the first passenger airline to use 
  <a href="https://blog.swiss.com/en/2022/02/aeroshark-wie-wir-co2-emissionen-mit-neuer-oberflaechentechnologie-reduzieren-english/"style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;">AeroSHARK</a> 
  technology on aircraft. 
  These aerodynamic 'riblets' will reduce fuel usage by 1.1% - good news on an industry level! 
  What does this mean for passengers who want to offset their CO<sub>2</sub> from flying?</p>

<p>Swiss is applying the AeroSHARK film to their fleet of 12 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, which usually fly long haul routes like ZRH-SFO. 
  For passengers, this adds another dimension of uncertainty to their CO<sub>2</sub> calculation. 
  No only do we need to know the start, destination, stopovers, airline, aircraft, load-factor and seating class of the passenger, 
  we now also need to know whether the aircraft was fitted with AeroSHARK!</p>

<p>However, in the battle against CO<sub>2</sub> emission uncertainties, this is not a big one. 
  Swiss Boeing 777-300ERs are fitted with 320 seats, so a 1.1% AeroSHARK induced CO<sub>2</sub> variation is equivalent to only 3.5 empty seats. 
  Flight durations of LX38 ZRH-SFO in the last week varied between 10h44 and 11h09, or 3.8% (flightradar24, accessed 2022-07-01). 
  1.1% of the great circle distance of 9399 km is just 104 km, easily swallowed by different route choices and weather over the North Atlantic.</p>

<p>While AeroSHARK is a small step toward reducing industry emissions, 
  for passengers it's another source of uncertainty when trying to calculate their CO<sub>2</sub> responsibility. 
  Emission calculators should reflect this!</p>
