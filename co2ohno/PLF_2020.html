<h1>Passenger load factors in 2020</h1>

<h4>Fewer planes, even fewer passengers</h4>

<p>No one needs telling that the number of flights reduced massively in 2020. 
Back in spring it was practically a novelty to see a plane in the sky. 
However, despite the huge extent to which airlines cut their services, 
passenger numbers dropped even more.</p>

<p>The passenger load factor indicates how full a plane was. 
All seats filled with passengers equals 100% load factor. 
It varies from airline to airline, but in 2019 the typical passenger load factor was above 80%. 
Using 
<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/publications/economics"style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;">IATA statistics</a>
, we can compare passenger load factors from 2019 with 2020. 
After a normal January, industry-wide average passenger load factors decrease dramatically to below 40% in April. 
Around summer time figures stabilised at 58%.</p>

<p>What does this mean for emissions? If the extra capacity goes unused, 
it means each traveler will be responsible for a larger share of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the plane. 
However, airlines may fill the extra capacity with freight, meaning no change for the individual. 
The truth is probably somewhere in between. 
Whatâ€™s clear is that the uncertainty on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions calculations in 2020 has increased.</p>
