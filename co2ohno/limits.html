<h1>Limits</h1>

<h4>Five orders of magnitude between minimum and maximum emissions</h4>

<p>We already saw that the average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per passenger per flight in 2018 was 213 kg. Obviously there will be a huge range of different results within that average... Can we put some estimate on the lower and upper limits? Googling around led to the following story.</p>

<p>The shortest commercial passenger flight in the world is the Loganair Westray to Papa Westray route. The 2.7 km flight takes about 1 minute in a Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander. This aircraft can carry 10 passengers (all economy) and has two Lycoming O-540-E4C5 piston engines, each 190 kW. Burning gasoline releases 13 kWh/kg, so the Islander at maximum power uses 30 kg of fuel an hour, or 0.5 kg of fuel a minute. Let’s take that as the estimate for the Westray route - also one minute which won’t be all at maximum power but which also doesn’t include taxi-ing. 0.5 kg gasoline produces 1.5 kg CO<sub>2</sub>. Assuming the plane was full, that’s 0.15 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger.</p>

<p>The longest commercial passenger flight in the world is the Singapore Airlines Singapore to Newark route. The 16,000 km flight takes over 18h in an A350-900ULR. This aircraft can carry 161 passengers (67 business, 94 premium economy) and on the first flight, burned 101.4 t of fuel. 101.4 t jet fuel produces 319,410 kg CO<sub>2</sub>. Let’s include an RF factor of 3 and say the plane was 50% full, that’s 12 t CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger.</p>
