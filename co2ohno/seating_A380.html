<h1>Seats on a plane</h1>

<h4>One aircraft model, many seating configurations</h4>

<p>To calculate an individual’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, we need to know how many seats there are on the plane. 
This isn’t a straightforward question. 
Different airlines choose different seating configurations for the same model of plane. 
Sometimes the same airline even has several layouts for the same model! 
The A380-800 is a good example.</p>

<p>The maximum capacity of the A380-800 is 868 seats, in single-class (economy) configuration. 
However, no airline operates such a layout. Using 
<a href="https://www.seatguru.com/"style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;">SeatGuru</a>, 
we see that the number of seats on an A380-800 varies by as much as 60% depending on airline and layout. 
At the two ends of the spectrum, Emirates layout 3 has 615 seats while Singapore Airlines layout 2 has 379. 
That’s a factor 1.6 different! 
Everything else being equal, a passenger on Singapore Airlines layout 2 will be responsible for 60% more CO<sub>2</sub> 
than a passenger on Emirates layout 3. 
Even within the same airline, Emirates layouts 1 and 3 and Singapore Airlines 2 and 3 are both a factor 1.25 different.</p>

<p>To properly calculate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, both aircraft model and seating configuration must be known.</p>
