<h1>Radiative forcing rationale</h1>

<h4>Bringing together the arguments for the different RF factors</h4>

<p>To try to understand where the different RF factors come from, 
I dug through all the calculators to see what they had to say about RF. 
Then I tried to follow any references they made. I brought all the information here. 
It's a long list - you can scroll through or click on the one you're interested in.</p>

<h2>Calculators</h2>

<h4 id="atmosfair">atmosfair</h4>
<p>"In order to appropriately represent the climate impact of all 
flight emissions, the atmosfair emissions calculator multiplies the 
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions emitted at altitudes over 9 km with the 
global average multiplicator of 3. This multiplicator results when 
the global warming potential of all non-CO<sub>2</sub> effects is 
integrated and discounted over 100 years (UNFCC) and <a href="#lee2010">
(David Lee et al., "Transport impacts on atmosphere and climate: Aviation", 
in atmospheric environment (44), 2010)</a>."</p>

<h4 id="brighterplanet">Brighterplanet</h4>
<p>"Aviation multiplier. A multiplier to account for the extra climate 
impact of greenhouse gas emissions high in the atmosphere. 
Use 2.0 after <a href="#kollmuss2009">Kollmuss and Crimmins (2009)</a>"</p>
<!--https://github.com/faradayio/flight/blob/master/lib/flight/impact_model.rb-->

<h4 id="c-level">C-Level</h4>
<p>"The emission factors used in our calculations take radiative forcing into 
account, which increases total emissions by 90%. Radiative forcing is the 
increased damage caused by emissions released into the atmosphere at high 
altitude rather than those released at sea-level."</p>

<h4 id="carbonfootprint">Carbonfootprint</h4>
<p>"Carbon emissions from planes at high altitude have an increased effect 
on global warming. Check the box if you would like to multiply aviation emissions 
by <a href="#defra">DEFRA</a>'s recommended Radiative Forcing factor of 1.891."</p>

<p>"Emissions from planes at high altitudes impact climate change more than if the 
emissions were released at ground level. To take account of this you have the 
option to factor up the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions released by aviation Radiative Forcing 
Factor of 1.9. From 2013, <a href="#defra">DEFRA</a> have include emissions factors to 
cover radiative forcing which have been used in the online calculators."</p>

<h4 id="carbonneutral">Carbon neutral</h4>
<p>"An RFI of 1.9 is applied against CO<sub>2</sub>"</p>

<p>"What is Radiative Forcing Index (RFI)?:  The <a href="#ipcc1999">IPCC</a> 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has identified that aircraft emissions 
at altitude have a greater impact on the atmosphere due to other non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
climate change effects from aviation (e.g. NOx, water vapour, contrails) and the RFI 
factors allows for these other impacts"</p>

<h4 id="carbonindependent">carbonindependent</h4>
<p>"Aircraft are thought to have greater climate effects than just the CO<sub>2</sub> 
emissions from burning the fuel. The additional effects include contributions from 
nitrous oxides and ozone. Because of this, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from aviation 
should perhaps be multiplied by an appropriate factor. The size of the factor is 
often taken to be 2.7"</p>
<p>(long quote)</p>
<p>"According to this statement, it is incorrect to multiply CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
by the RFI, but it is also incorrect to ignore them. For the purposes of a calculator, 
some decision must be taken until further evidence is available, and the Carbon Independent 
calculator will for the time being multiply aviation CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by a 
factor of 2.0."</p>

<h4 id="carbonfund">carbonfund</h4>
<p>"At high altitudes, the effect of greenhouse gases is considerably different 
than on the ground level. Aircraft also emit water vapor during flight which can 
cause the formation of ice clouds, called contrails. Where contrails persist, 
cirrus clouds begin to form which have an additional impact on global warming. 
Clouds can have a double effect on radiation: they warm the earth by reducing the 
amount of radiation from the earth that escapes into space but also cool the earth 
by reflecting the sunís rays back into space. However, contrails lead to a net 
warming factor, which is estimated to be 2.7 times the normal effect 
<a href="#ipcc1999">(IPCC, 1999)</a>."</p>

<h4 id="chooseclimate">Choose climate</h4>
<p>"And remember: that's just the CO<sub>2</sub>: the total warming effect of 
CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + NOx is about 3 times greater."</p>

<p>"The total warming effect of all emissions (CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and NOx) 
put together, is in the range 2-5 times greater than that of CO<sub>2</sub> alone. 
This range was confirmed by analysis in the "Special Report on Aviation" published by 
the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" (<a href="#ipcc1999">IPCC</a>) 
in April 1999."</p>

<h4 id="climatecare">Climate care</h4>
<p>"Radiative Forcing Index (RFI) is a multiplier that takes account of the extra 
gases emitted to the atmosphere when you fly at altitude – which are greater than 
burning fossil fuels at ground level.  Scientists estimate the impact is between 
1 and 4 times greater and it is considered best practice by <a href="#defra">Defra/DECC</a> 
to include a multiplier of 1.9 to take account of these impacts. ClimateCare includes 
an RFI multiplier in all our flight calculations."</p>

<h4 id="co2nsensus">Co2nsensus</h4>
<p>"CO2nnector adopts The <a href="#icao">ICAO</a> Carbon Emissions methodology by 
The International Civil Aviation Organization for emission caused by your flights"</p>

<h4 id="flygreen">Flygreen</h4>
<p>"We chose for the calculation factors of <a href="#defra">DEFRA</a>"</p>
<p>"This estimate is in the same order as the UK Government (<a href="#defra">DEFRA</a>) 
and FlyGRN uses (1.9)."</p>

<h4 id="greentripper">Greentripper</h4>
<p>"Radiative forcing (RF) is caused by contrails, the white could stripes left behind 
planes. They have an additional greenhouse effect. Independent science (Bilan Carbone, 
ADEME) estimates that RF of aviation is 2 times that of just CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
from burning kerosene."</p>

<h4 id="icao">ICAO</h4>
<p>"Why does ICAO not take account of non-CO<sub>2</sub> effects in the methodology? 
The ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator is limited to the calculation of the CO<sub>2</sub> 
amounts released into the atmosphere by the aircraft engines during a flight. Consequently, 
the ICAO Emissions Calculator does not quantify the climate change impact of aircraft 
emissions using the Radiative Forcing Index (RFI) or other such multipliers. The scientific 
community has not yet reached consensus on the use of the RFI or other such multipliers 
and therefore ICAO will only adopt a multiplier if and when the scientific community reaches 
a general agreement on this issue. ICAO is working in collaboration with IPCC on this subject 
and will adapt a multiplier methodology in due course accordingly."</p>

<h4 id="myclimate">Myclimate</h4>
<p>"Aircrafts do not only emit CO<sub>2</sub> but also other forcing agents that affect 
the Earth’s radiative balance and thus the climate. Amongst other factors, emissions 
from aviation also lead to short-term increases in tropospheric ozone as a consequence 
of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, initiate condensation trails (contrails) and may 
affect the formation of cirrus clouds. The total radiative effects have thus been estimated 
to be two to four times larger than the direct CO<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing. However, 
research is ongoing inorder to constrain the uncertainties. Furthermore, a comparison of 
CO<sub>2</sub> and non-CO<sub>2</sub> effects is particularly challenging as they act on 
different time scales. Still, ignoring these effects would not be a far-sighted scientific 
approach. Latest studies <a href="#jungbluth2018">(Jungbluth &amp; Meili 2018)</a>, based 
on the correct interpretation of the most recent scientific publications, recommend an RFI 
factor of 2 on total aircraft CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This substantiates the myclimate 
calculations, as myclimate already decided to multiply the estimated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
by a factor of 2 (referred to as multiplier) to account for the warming effect due to 
non-CO<sub>2</sub> aircraft emissions (<a href="#jungbluth2018">Jungbluth &amp; Meili 2018</a>, 
<a href="#kollmuss2009">Kollmuss &amp; Crimmins 2009</a>)."</p>

<h4 id="myclimate-l-s">Myclimate-lufthansa and -swiss</h4>
<p>"Besides CO<sub>2</sub>, are any other emissions included in the calculation 
of the offset amount? No, only CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are included in the 
Lufthansa/SWISS calculator. This is because in science there is only a clear certainty 
with regard to the aviation sector about the climate impact of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
However, after calculating the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions each customer has the option of 
varying the payment by clicking on "I'd rather donate a different amount instead"."</p>

<p>"In addition to CO<sub>2</sub>, air transport also produces further emissions 
(especially nitrogen oxides and water vapour) that are believed to contribute to climate 
change. Science has not yet, however, been able to determine the precise extent of their 
contribution here. In view of this, the emissions calculator that myclimate provides for 
SWISS and Lufthansa does not consider any other types of emission apart from carbon dioxide."</p>

<h4 id="omnicalculator">Omnicalculator - flight emissions</h4>
<p>"Radiative forcing factor: finally, the emission takes place high in the atmosphere, 
and that's precisely where we don't want the CO<sub>2</sub> to be because of its greenhouse 
effect. To account for that, we include a radiative forcing factor. We take its value to be 2, 
based again on the analysis from <a href="#carbonindependent">www.carbonindependent.org</a>."</p>

<h4 id="southpole">South pole</h4>
<p>"Finally, South Pole’s methodology also takes into account indirect emissions such as ... 
and a Radiative Forcing Index (RFI) multiplier of 1.9 to account for non-CO<sub>2</sub> 
climate change effects from air travel. This includes contrails, water vapour, NOx 
emissions, etc. <a href="#defra">UKBEIS</a> recommends a multiplier of 1.9 as a central 
estimate, based on research from the European Assessment of Transport Impacts on Climate 
Change and Ozone Depletion (ATTICA, http://ssa-attica.eu) and analysis by Lee et al (2009) 
reported on by the Committee on Climate4Change (2009)."</p>

<h4 id="terrapass">Terrapass</h4>
<p>"For a variety of reasons, greenhouse gas emissions created high in the atmosphere are 
thought by scientists to be worse than greenhouse gas emissions at ground level. This is 
sometimes referred to as Radiative Forcing. Unfortunately, no consensus yet exists as to 
how much worse, so presently terrapass doesn’t take this effect into account. If and when 
a scientific consensus on radiative forcing develops, we will update our calculations accordingly."</p>

<h2>Reports and Articles</h2>

<h4 id="ipcc1999">IPCC, Aviation and the Global Atmosphere (1999)</h4>
<p>Summary for policymakers 4.8. What are the Overall Climate Effects of Subsonic Aircraft?<br />
"the overall radiative forcing by aircraft (excluding that from changes in cirrus clouds) 
for all scenarios in this report is a factor of 2 to 4 larger than the forcing 
by aircraft carbon dioxide alone"</p>

<p>Chapter 6 Executive summary<br />
"The Radiative Forcing Index (RFI)-the ratio of total radiative forcing to that from 
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions alone-is a measure of the importance of aircraft-induced climate 
change other than that from the release of fossil carbon alone. In 1992, the RFI for aircraft 
is 2.7; it evolves to 2.6 in 2050 for the Fa1 scenario. This index ranges from 2.2 to 3.4 for 
the year 2050 for various E- and F-type scenarios for subsonic aviation and technical options 
considered here. The RFI increases from 2.6 to 3.4 with the addition of HSCTs (scenario Fa1H), 
primarily as a result of the effects of stratospheric water vapor. Thus, aircraft-induced climate 
change with RFI > 1 points to the need for a more thorough climate assessment for this sector. 
By comparison, in the IS92a scenario the RFI for all human activities is about 1, although for 
greenhouse gases alone it is about 1.5, and it is even higher for sectors emitting CH<sub>4</sub> 
and N<sub>2</sub>O without significant fossil fuel use."</p>

<p>6.6.5. Climate Change<br />
"In 1992, the RFI for aircraft was about 2.7, with an uncertainty of at least &plusmn;1.5. 
The RFI changes to 3.0 by 2015 then drops to 2.6 for the Fa1 scenario (see Table 6-1). This 
index ranges from 2.2 to 3.4 in the year 2050 for the various E- and F-type scenarios for subsonic 
aviation and technical options considered here. The RFI increases from 2.6 to 3.4 with the addition 
of HSCT aircraft (scenario Fa1H), as a result of the effects of stratospheric water vapor."</p>

<h4 id="sausen2005">Sausen et al., Aviation radiative forcing in 2000: An update on IPCC (1999) (2005)</h4>
<p>Quoting the DEFRA interpretation of this paper:<br />
"Estimates for scaling CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to account for Radiative Forcing 
impacts are not quoted directly in the table, but are derived as follows:<br />
IPCC (1999) = 48.5/18.0 = 2.69 ≈ 2.7<br />
TRADEOFF = 47.8/25.3 = 1.89 ≈ 1.9"</p>

<h4 id="kollmuss2009">Kollmus &amp; Crimmins, Carbon Offsetting &amp; Air Travel 
Part 2: Non-CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Calculations (2009)</h4>
<p>"a multiplier of 2 or greater should be used for air travel emissions calculators 
to account for non-CO<sub>2</sub> warming effects"</p>

<h4 id="lee2010">Lee et al., Transport impacts on atmosphere and climate: Aviation (2010)</h4>
<p>"Emission-based metrics such as the GWP and GTP have been reviewed and formulated 
into CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions. The value of these depends on the time-horizon 
selected. Emissions weighting factors that represent the total effect of aviation as a 
ratio to that of CO<sub>2</sub> have been calculated and presented for GWPs and GTP 
metrics and different time-horizons. For GWPs, these range from 4.3 to 4.8 (GWP20) and 
1.9–2.0 (GWP100) for 2005, including AIC; excluding AIC they are 2.1–2.6 (GWP20) and 
1.3–1.4 (GWP100). In the context of these calculations, AIC has a similar uncertainty 
to aviation NOx GWPs, given that the few different estimates change in sign."</p>

<h4 id="jungbluth2018">Jungbluth &amp; Meili, Recommendations for calculation of the 
global warming potential of aviation including the radiative forcing index (2018)</h4>
<p>"An RFI factor of 2 on total aircraft CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is recommended 
in this article because it is based on the correct interpretation of the most recent 
scientific publications. If detailed data on the share of emissions in the higher 
atmosphere are available, calculations will be more accurate if the CO<sub>2</sub> 
emissions in the higher atmosphere are multiplied by a factor of 5.2."<br />
Where "higher atmosphere" seems to be the stratosphere. The height that the stratosphere 
starts depends on where you are. From wikipedia: "Near the equator, the stratosphere 
starts at as high as 20 km, around 10 km at midlatitudes, and at about 7 km at the poles."</p>

<h4 id="defra">UK government (2009-2019)</h4>
<p>Every year the UK government publishes emission conversion factors for greenhouse 
gas company reporting. Depending on the year, the department can be called BEIS (2016-2019), 
DECC (2014-2015) or DEFRA (2009-2013). I looked back as far as possible and picked 
out the relevant bits:</p>

<p>2014-2019<br />
"A multiplier of 1.9 is recommended as a central estimate"<br />
"It is important to note that the value of this 1.9 multiplier is subject to significant uncertainty"<br />

<p>2010-2013<br />
"A multiplier of 1.9 is recommended as a central estimate"<br />
Reference <a href="#sausen2005">Sausen et al. (2005)</a></p>

<p>2009<br />
"The appropriate factor to apply is subject to uncertainty but was estimated by the 
<a href="#ipcc1999">IPCC in 1999</a> to be in the range 2-4, with current best scientific 
evidence suggesting a factor of 1.9."</p>
