<h1>Passenger load factor</h1>

<h4>The false friend disguised as a scaling factor</h4>

<p>We saw previously that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions calculators 
take into account the passenger load factor by scaling the same 
total emissions by the occupancy. I see two possible issues with 
this reasoning.</p>

<p>Firstly, the assumption that the total emissions stays the same 
isnâ€™t true if we follow the approach of the calculators, and simply 
vary the number of passengers. The payload (passengers, luggage) 
accounts for about 25% of the total weight of the plane, fuel accounts 
for another 25% and the aircraft body accounts for 50%. Reducing the 
payload by half (50% passenger load factor) therefore reduces total 
weight by 12.5%. A 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft#Weight"style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;">rule-of-thumb</a> 
is that each 1% reduction in weight results in a 0.75% reduction in 
fuel consumption. Therefore, with only 50% passenger load factor the 
plane would burn 0.75x12.5 = 10% less fuel, not taking into account 
the weight saving from not needing that 10% fuel. Comparing this 
'decreasing passenger load factor means decreasing total emissions' 
model with the 'total emissions stays the same for all passenger load 
factors' model, we clearly see that the data points from the emissions 
calculators follow the constant emissions model.</p>

<p>The second issue, and the elephant in the room here, is cargo. 
Passenger planes do carry cargo, I read estimates that cargo contributes 
<a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/flight/modern/air-freight1.htm"style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;">5-10%</a> 
or 
<a href="https://skift.com/2014/08/04/when-airlines-worry-more-about-cargo-than-they-do-about-passengers/"style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;">15-20%</a> 
of their revenue. Reducing the passenger load factor on a particular 
flight allows the airline to increase the cargo. I wasn't able to find 
any data to analyse yet, but it seems logical that passenger load factor 
and cargo load factor will be inversely proportional, with airlines 
always operating close to their optimal weight. Otherwise they're 
just flying around 50% body and 25% fuel for less than 25% profit 
making payload. If the cargo is 'responsible' for its fraction of 
the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the same way that passengers are, 
then so long as the total payload weight (passengers plus cargo) 
remains constant, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per passenger should 
be independent of passenger load factor.</p>
