<h1>Passenger load factor</h1>

<h4>Scaling emissions by occupancy</h4>

<p>Some of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions calculators allow the user to 
input the passenger load factor (PLF) - the fraction of seats on the 
plane that are full. Varying this factor for a couple of routes, we see 
that the results follow a simple relationship: emissions per passenger 
for a particular PLF = emissions per passenger for PLF=1 / PLF. The total 
amount of emissions stays the same, but fewer passengers are responsible 
for it.</p>

<p>Going along with this reasoning (I have some doubts, but I’ll address 
them another time) this makes passenger load factor quite a relevant input 
for a CO<sub>2</sub> emission calculation. If the plane were only half full, 
then using this reasoning each passenger would be responsible for twice the 
amount of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>How much does passenger load factor vary in reality? Ryanair achieved an 
average passenger load factor of 
<a href="https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ryanair-2019-Annual-Report.pdf"style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;">96%</a> 
over the last year, Emirates 
<a href="https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-group-announces-2018-19-results/"style="color:blue;text-decoration:none;">77%</a>.

that ATR72 200/500/600 aircraft on domestic routes average 64%, while Boeing 
787-800 Dreamliner aircraft on short haul routes average 93%. There’s clearly 
quite a spread to these figures, so the overall average of around 80% won’t 
tell the full story.</p>
